## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/headshot.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Rocco Vitela I am a sophomore Mechanical Engineering student with a strong interest in mechanical design and engineering simulation. My experience centers on computer-aided design and basic structural analysis, where I enjoy applying technical tools to solve practical engineering challenges.

I have eight months of CAD experience, primarily with SolidWorks, and hold the
Certified SolidWorks Associate (CSWA) certification. This past summer, I was selected to
participate in the NACME Autodesk Engineering Design Bootcamp, where I completed
a month of instruction and earned certification as a Fusion 360 Certified User.
In addition, I have one month of hands-on experience with Finite Element Analysis using
Ansys Workbench. My work has focused on mesh creation, linear static structural
analysis, and modal analysis.
